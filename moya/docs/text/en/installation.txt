[title Installing Moya]

Moya is distributed as a Python module.

[h1]Requirements[/h1]

Moya supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.3+. Support for Python 2.7 will continue for its lifespan -- likely many years yet.

[h1]Linux[/h1]

Moya requires [url http://lxml.de]lxml[/url]. Probably the simplest way to install lxml is via your package manager:

[code]
$ sudo apt-get install python-lxml
[/code]

[aside]If you are using Python 3, install [b]python3-lxml[/b][/aside]

You can then install Moya with the following:

[code]
$ sudo pip install moya
[/code]

[h1]Windows[/h1]

You can stall Moya on Windows with the following:

[code]
pip install moya
[/code]

If you get errors about lxml not installing, you may need to install lxml separately. Download a binary from [url http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml]http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml[/url] and install with pip. Then run install Moya again (with pip).

[h1]OSX[/h1]

Moya has only been tested on Linux / Window so far.

[h1]Installing from Source[/h1]

If you want the cutting edge code, you can install the latest from GitHub. The Moya repos also contains example projects that you may want to try out.

To get the source, clone the [url https://github.com/moyaproject/moya]Moya GitHub repository[/url], then run the following:

[code]
$ sudo python setup.py install
[/code]

[h1]Command Line Application [/h1]

After installation you should have the [c]moya[/c] command available on the command line. Enter the following in a terminal to confirm installation was successful and display the version number:

[code]
$ moya -v
[/code]

The command app has extensive help; run the following to get help information on the available sub-commands:

[code]
$ moya -h
[/code]

You can get help on a sub-command by typing [c]moya[/c] followed by the name of the sub-command and [c]-h[/c]. Here's an example:

[code]
$ moya runserver -h
[/code]
