[title Installing Moya]

Moya is distributed as a Python module.

[h1]Requirements[/h1]

Moya supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.3+. Support for Python 2.7 will continue for its lifespan -- likely many years yet.

[h1]Install from PyPi[/h1]

Moya is available on PyPi, and may be installed via pip:

[code]
$ pip install moya
[/code]

[h1]Install from code[/h1]

If you want the cutting edge code, you can install the latest from github. The Moya repos also contains example projects that you may want to try out.

[h1]Command Line Application[/h1]

After installation you should have the [c]moya[/c] command available on the command line. Enter the following in a terminal to confirm installation was successful and display the version number:

[code]
$ moya -v
[/code]

The command app has extensive help; run the following to get help information on the available sub-commands:

[code]
$ moya -h
[/code]

You can get help on a sub-command by typing [c]moya[/c] followed by the name of the sub-command and [c]-h[/c]. Here's an example:

[code]
$ moya runserver -h
[/code]
