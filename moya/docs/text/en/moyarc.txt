[title MoyaRC]

The [c]moya[/c] command line tools loads the file [c].moyarc[/c] from your home directory. It can be used to configure defaults and behaviour for subcommands.

[h1]Sections[/h1]

The following is a list of sections in [c].moyarc[/c]:

[h2][author][/h2]

This section is primary used by the [c]moya start[/c] command which use these values, if not supplied.

[setting]name = <YOUR NAME>[/setting]

The name of the library author.

[setting]url = <URL>[/setting]

The author's URL (e.g. a blog or homepage)

[setting]organization = <ORGANIZATION NAME>[/setting]

The name of the author's organization. If you don't have a particular organization, you can enter your own name here.

[setting]email = <YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS>[/setting]

The author's email address.

[h2][defaults][/h2]

Contains default values for the command line.

[setting]ini = <SETTINGS FILENAME>[/setting]

The INI file to read when running subcommands. The default is to read [c]settings.ini[/c] if this value is not supplied.

On a production server, you might want to set the following:

[code ini]
[defaults]
ini = production.ini
[/code]

This will load production settings by default.

A common pattern with Moya is to have a file called [c]local.ini[/c] which contains settings local to the server (such as db settings). These would [i]not[/i] be checked in to source control. You can tell Moya to load [c]local.ini[/c] if it exits, or [c]production.ini[/c] if it doesn't, by specifying both filenames as follows:

[code ini]
[defaults]
ini = local.ini
    production.ini
[/code]

You can set as many filenames as you wish--Moya will try each one in turn.
