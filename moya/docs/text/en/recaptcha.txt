[title Moya Google Recaptcha]

 [url https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html]Google reCAPTCHA[/url] is a service from Google that prevents bots (automated systems) from accessing your web application. Mosts bots are malicious in nature, and attempt to [i]spam[/i] your site with links to products, or to test for potential exploits.

 [aside]CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computer and Human Apart.[/aside]

[h1]Installation[/h1]

Moya Google Recaptcha is built in to Moya and may be imported from its Python path as follows:

[code xml]
<import py="moya.libs.recaptcha" />
[/code]

And installed as follows:

[code xml]
<install name="recaptcha" lib="moya.google.recaptcha" />
[/code]

This library's long name is [c]moya.google.recaptcha[/c] to reflect the fact that it is packaged by Moya, but the author is [url http://google.com]Google[/url].

[h1]Namespace[/h1]

The XML namespace for this library is [c]http://moyaproject.com/recaptcha[/c]. The XML prefix is assumed to be [c]recaptcha:[/c] for the the examples in this document.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

To use reCAPTCHA, you will need two keys; a [i]site[/i] key which identifies the URL your web application will run on, and a [i]secret[/i] key which is used when checking the user's response. You can get both keys by [url https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html]signing up[/url].

[h1]Settings[/h1]

This library has the following settings:

[setting]sitekey = <SITEKEY>[/setting]

This should be your site key.

[setting]secretkey = <SECRETKEY>[/setting]

This should be your secret key.

[h1]Usage[/h1]

This library supplies a tag called [tag recaptcha]recaptcha[/tag] which should be embedded in a [tag forms]form[/tag] as follows:

[code xml]
<field name="g-recaptcha-response">
    <recaptcha:recaptcha/>
</field>
[/code]

When the user fills in the CAPTCHA, it writes a reCAPTCHA response value called [c]g-recaptcha-response[/c] to the form (this name can not be changed). You can then check reCAPTCHA response with [tag recaptcha]verify[/tag], which will return [c]True[/c] if the user is likely a human. This may done directly in the form with the following:

[code xml]
<validate-field field="g-recaptcha-response">
    <recaptcha:verify response="value" dst="human"/>
    <fail if="not human">
        CAPTCHA failed. You may be a bot.
    </fail>
</validate-field>
[/code]
