[title Moya Debug]

Moya Debug is a built in library that enables some debug only features. The primary feature is the error page that renders a Moya Traceback and error information.

[h1]Installation[/h1]

Moya Debug is a built in library, and may be installed via its Python path as follows:

[code xml]
<import py="moya.libs.debug" if=".debug" priority="100"/>
[/code]

The [c]if=".debug"[/c] test ensures that Moya Debug is only imported when debug mode is enabled. Debug mode is enabled in settings as follows:

[code ini]
[project]
debug = yes
[/code]

Your [c]production.ini[/c] will set [c]debug[/c] to [c]no[/c] to disable Moya Debug in a production environment.

The [c]priority="100"[/c] attribute ensures that templates in Moya Debug have the highest priority -- in order to override any error handlers you have created.

You may install the library with the following line:

[code xml]
<install name="debug" lib="moya.debug" mount="/debug/" if=".debug" />
[/code]

This mounts the debug views on [c]/debug/[/c] (if the server is running in debug mode).


[h1]Error Handlers[/h1]

Moya Debug supplies handlers for 404 (not found) and 500 (internal error) pages by overriding the [c]404.html[/c] and [c]500.html[/c] templates respectively.

[h2]Not Found[/h2]

The Not Found page will display information about the request, and the URL routes Moya ran through to attempt to generate a response. There are two possible scenarios that generate a 404 page; either there was no route matching the URL, or a route was found but your code intentionally returned a Not Found response. The Trace panel on the debug 404 page will tell you which was the case.

[h2]Internal Error[/h2]

The Internal Error page will display information about the request, plus snapshot of the code being executed when the error occurred -- which may be Moya code or template.

[h1]User Views[/h1]

The url [c]/debug/user/[/c] whil show you information about the currently logged in user, including groups and permissions. You can also view the same information on other users by visiting [c]/debug/user/<USERNAME/[/c].

[h1]Code Introspection[/h1]

Moya Debug can display the code for any element -- with syntax highlighting. Clicking a element reference in the 404 page will link to the debug view that displays code. For example, [c]/debug/element/moya.pages%23view.page/[/c].

[aside]The [c]%23[/c] in the URL above is how browsers escape the # character.[/aside]

Moya Debug can also display templates from the template filesystem. For example [c]/debug/templates/500.html[/c] would show you the template Moya Debug uses to render the Internal Error page.
