[title Status Codes]

The following is a list of [url http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes]HTTP status codes[/url]. The text and numeric code are interchangeable where Moya expects a status code. Using the text label is preferable as it is self documenting.

If the response code isn't listed here, you may still use the numeric code.

[aside]It is unlikely that you will need more than a handful of these status codes in a project.[/aside]
