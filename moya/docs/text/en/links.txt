[title Moya Links]

Moya Links provides a way for libraries to advertise hyper-links for a particular purpose. This is typically used to add links to a menu or sub-menu of some kind.

[h1]Installation[/h1]

Moya Links is built in to Moya and may be imported with the following:

[code xml]
<import py="moya.libs.links" />
[/code]

The following will install Moya Links:

[code xml]
<install name="links" lib="moya.links" />
[/code]

There is no need to mount this library, as there are no views, just custom tags.

[h1]Namespace[/h1]

Moya Links uses the namespace [c]http://moyaproject.com/links[/c]. Link tags in this document are assumed to have the XML prefix [c]links:[/c] declared.

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

The [c]moya start[/c] command uses the Moya Links library to define which links are displayed on the top [i]navbar[/i] (menu at the top of the page); it writes following file in your site application ([c]site/logic/data.xml[/c]):

[code xml]
<moya xmlns="http://moyaproject.com"
      xmlns:links="http://moyaproject.com/links">

    <links:link text="About" from="pages" name="showpage" with="{'pagename': 'about'}"
        if=".apps.pages"/>
    <links:link text="Blog" from="blog" name="list"
        if=".apps.blog" />
    <links:link text="Contact" from="pages" name="showpage" with="{'pagename': 'contact'}"
        if=".apps.pages"/>
    <links:link text="Feedback" from="feedback" name="feedback"
        if=".apps.feedback" />
    <links:link text="Debug" from="debug" name="intro"
        if=".apps.debug and .debug" />
    <links:link text="API" from="site" name="jsonrpc"
        if=".apps.jsonrpc" />

</moya>
[/code]

The above file sets the navbar links, but [i]only[/i] if the relevant application is installed. Otherwise there would be broken links -- and you wouldn't have a very good impression of Moya.

The start command also writes the following file ([c]site/logic/content.xml[/c]):

[code xml]
<moya xmlns="http://moyaproject.com"
      xmlns:links="http://moyaproject.com/links">

    <content libname="content.base">
        <links:get dst="navlinks" />
    </content>

</moya>
[/code]

This contains the base [link content]content[/link] definition which is inherited by all [tag]content[/tag] tags in your project. The call to [tag links]get[/tag] retrieves a value called [c]navlinks[/c] which contains a list of links, which is ultimately used to render the navbar in your base template.

See the rest of the document for the details on using the links tags.

[h1]Tags[/h1]

Moya Links supplies two tags; [tag links]link[/tag] which defines links, and [tag links]get[/tag] which retrieves a list of those links.

[h2]Link Tag[/h2]

The [tag links]link[/tag] defines a link to a page installed in your project. The following example defines two links; to the login page and about page:

[code xml]
<links:link from="moya.auth" name="login" text="Login to Sushi Finder" />
<links:link from="sushifinder.shop" name="cart" text="Shopping Cart" />
[/code]

You can also add the URL explicitly, which might be necessary if you want a link to an external page. For example:

[code xml]
<link:link url="http://moyaproject.com" text="Moya"/>
[/code]

Link tags also have a [c]purpose[/c] attribute which allows you to categorize links. You may have a category for a main menu / sub-menu / footer links etc. The following example defines links for typical footer:

[code xml]
<links:link purpose="footer" from="moya.pages" name="about" text="About" />
<links:link purpose="footer" from="moya.pages" name="contact" text="Contact" />
<links:link purpose="footer" from="moya.pages" name="terms-and-conditions" text="Terms and Conditions" />
[/code]

[h2]Get Tag[/h2]

The [tag links]get[/tag] tag can retrieve a collection of links.

[code xml]
<links:get dst="links" />
[/code]

This will retrieve the link tags and extract a list of dictionaries containing the following information:

[definitions]
[define url]The URL for the link.[/define]
[define text]Text associated with the link.[/define]
[/definitions]

You could use the links list in a template such as the following:

[code moyatemplate]
<div class="menu">
{% for link in links %}
    <a href="${link.url}">${link.text}</a>
{% endfor %}
</div>
[/code]

You can set a [c]purpose[/c] attribute on [tag links]get[/tag] which gathers only [tag links]link[/tag] tags with the same value for [c]purpose[/c]. For example, the following would get the footer tags defined previously:

[code xml]
<links:get dst="footer_links" purpose="footer"/>
[/code]
