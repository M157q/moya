        "body": "[title Installing Moya]\n\nMoya is distributed as a Python module.\n\n[h1]Requirements[/h1]\n\nMoya supports Python 2.7, and Python 3.3+. Support for Python 2.7 will continue for its lifespan -- likely many years yet.\n\n[h1]Linux[/h1]\n\nMoya requires [url http://lxml.de]lxml[/url]. Probably the simplest way to install lxml is via your package manager:\n\n[code]\nsudo apt-get install python-lxml\n[/code]\n\n[aside]If you are using Python 3, install [b]python3-lxml[/b][/aside]\n\nIf your package manager doesn't offer lxml, you will need to install libxml2 and libxslt:\n\n[code]\nsudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev python-dev\n[/code]\n\nSee the official [url http://lxml.de/installation.html#requirements]documentation on installing lxml[/url] if you have any problems.\n\nYou can then install Moya with the following:\n\n[code]\nsudo pip install moya\n[/code]\n\n[h1]Windows[/h1]\n\nYou can stall Moya on Windows with the following:\n\n[code]\npip install moya\n[/code]\n\nIf you get errors about lxml not installing, you may need to install lxml separately. Download a binary from [url http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml]http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#lxml[/url] and install with pip. Then run install Moya again (with pip).\n\n[h1]OSX[/h1]\n\nIf you have a Python environment set up, then the following command will install Moya:\n\n[code]\npip install moya\n[/code]\n\nIf you don't have Python + Pip set up, you can install them via Homebrew. Follow the official [url http://brew.sh/]instructions[/url] to install Homebrew. Then run the following to install Python + Pip + Moya:\n\n[code]\nbrew install python\npip install pip -U\npip install moya\n[/code]\n\n[h1]Installing from Source[/h1]\n\nIf you want the cutting edge code, you can install the latest from GitHub. The Moya repos also contains example projects that you may want to try out.\n\nTo get the source, clone the [url https://github.com/moyaproject/moya]Moya GitHub repository[/url], then run the following:\n\n[code]\n$ sudo python setup.py install\n[/code]\n\n[h1]Command Line Application [/h1]\n\nAfter installation you should have the [c]moya[/c] command available on the command line. Enter the following in a terminal to confirm installation was successful and display the version number:\n\n[code]\n$ moya -v\n[/code]\n\nThe command app has extensive help; run the following to get help information on the available sub-commands:\n\n[code]\n$ moya -h\n[/code]\n\nYou can get help on a sub-command by typing [c]moya[/c] followed by the name of the sub-command and [c]-h[/c]. Here's an example:\n\n[code]\n$ moya runserver -h\n[/code]",
