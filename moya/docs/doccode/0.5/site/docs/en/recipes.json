Well, the URL [url https://www.bitstamp.net/api/ticker/]https://www.bitstamp.net/api/ticker/[/url] contains a JSON object with the current Bitcoin prices. The [link expressions#get]get:[/link] modifier reads that request from the internet, and the [link expressions#fromjson]fromjson:[/link] modifier converts the text in to a dictionary with a number of values. Finally the index operator [c]['ask'][/c] looks up the value of [c]'ask'[/c] which is the current asking price.\n\n[alert NOTE]This recipe depends on the the bitstamp api. We can't guarantee that will still be working, but we would be surprised if isn't.[/alert]",
