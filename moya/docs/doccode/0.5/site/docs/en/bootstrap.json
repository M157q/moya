One advantage of Bootstrap is that it is easy to customize, and there are many drop-in themes available.\n\n[alert NOTE]Moya doesn't [i]require[/i] Bootstrap. It's just used to give you a head start with designing stylesheets.[/alert]\n\n[h1]Media[/h1]\n\nMoya Bootstrap provides a number of media files, which you can list with the following command:\n\n[code]\n$ moya fs media --tree bootstrap-media\n[/code]\n\nThe simplest way to include the Bootstrap CSS would be to add it to your base template:\n\n[code moyatemplate]\n<link href=\"{% media 'css/bootstrap.css' from 'twitter.bootstrap' %}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n[/code]\n\nIf you built a Moya project with [c]moya.start[/c], the CSS will have been included for you in the base template. The following command will display the base template in the terminal:\n\n[code]\n$ moya fs templates --cat moya.twitter.bootstrap/starter.html\n[/code]",
