User's may unsubscribe from these emails at any point.\n\n[h1]Installation[/h1]\n\nMoya Comments is built in to Moya, and may be imported via its Python path as follows:\n\n[code xml]\n<import py=\"moya.libs.comments\"/>\n[/code]\n\nYou can install Moya Comments with the following:\n\n[code xml]\n<install name=\"comments\" lib=\"moya.comments\" mount=\"/comments/\" />\n[/code]\n\nThe mount URL is used for few forms and the inner workings of the comments system, users will be able to make comments on any page.\n\n[h1]Settings[/h1]\n\n[setting]email_from = <EMAIL ADDRESS>[/setting]\n\nThis sets the email address that emails regarding notifications will be sent from.\n\n[setting]recaptcha = <yes/no>[/setting]\n\nIf [c]yes[/c], Moya Comments will require a CAPTCHA to post anonymously. See [doc recaptcha].\n\n[h1]Comment Widget[/h1]\n\nTo enable comments on a page add a [tag comments]comment[/tag] to your content, where you want the comments to appear (typically near the end of the page).\n\nThe [tag comments]comments[/tag] widget needs two pieces of information in order to associate comments with the comment [i]topic[/i]; these are [c]topic[/c] and [c]namespace[/c]. The [c]topic[/c] attribute is a string which should be unique to type of topic. Since the comment topic is likely a database object of some kind, a sensible choice would be name of the object type and its primary key. For example [c]post-${post.id}[/c]. The [c]namespace[/c] is a similar string, which can be any format you like, as long as the combination of [c]namespace[/c] and [c]topic[/c] is unique in your website. If your topic is a database object, then a [c]namespace[/c] that includes the application name should be enough to make the combination unique.\n\nYou can also supply a [c]url[/c] attribute, which is used to redirect back to the page containing the topic when a comment is posted. It is also stored along with the comments, so you can reference it in the admin view. If you don't supply a [c]url[/c], Moya Comments will use the current url being processed.\n\nHere's an example of how to enable comments:\n\n[code xml]\n<comments:comments namespace=\"app-${.app.name}\" topic=\"post-${post.id}\"/>\n[/code]\n\nNote that the namespace plus topic scheme ensures that even if you change your URL structures, Moya will be able to keep track of the comments on that page.\n\n[h1]Comment Counts[/h1]\n\nMoya Comments also supplies the [tag comments]get-count[/tag] tag to get the number of comments on a particular topic. You would use this if you want to display the number of comments in some kind of summary page. Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<for src=\"posts\" dst=\"post\">\n    <comments:get-count namespace=\"app-post\" topic=\"post-${post.id}\" dst=\"count\"/>\n    <html:h1>${post.title}</html:h1>\n    <html:p>${count} comment(s)</html:p>\n</for>\n[/code]\n\nThis would be used in a content definition to add a [c]<h1>[/c] tag for each post, followed by the number of comments on the post.\n\nTo avoid doing a database query for every object you want to get the comment counts for, you can use [tag comments]get-counts[/tag] which gets the counts for a group of topics (in a single query). It returns a dictionary that maps the topic on to the number of comments.\n\nThe following does the same thing as the preceding example, but uses a single call to [tag comments]get-counts[/tag], rather than multiple [tag comments]get-count[/tag] calls:\n\n[code xml]\n<comments:get-counts namespace=\"app-post\" dst=\"counts\" />\n<for src=\"posts\" dst=\"post\">\n    <html:h1>${post.title}</html:h1>\n    <html:p>${counts['post-' + post.id]} comment(s)</html:p>\n</form>\n[/code]",
