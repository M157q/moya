        "body": "[title Moya Auth (users and permissions)]\n\nThe Moya Auth library provides the ability for users to [i]log in[/i] to your web application, and manages what they can do (or see) when they are there. Most sites will require some kind of system of users, even if it is a single [i]admin[/i] user who may make changes to the site.\n\n[h1]Installation[/h1]\n\nThe Moya Auth library is built in to Moya and may be imported via its Python path as follows:\n\n[code xml]\n<import py=\"moya.libs.forms\" />\n[/code]\n\nYou can install the library with the following:\n\n[code xml]\n<install name=\"auth\" lib=\"moya.auth\" mount=\"/auth/\"/>\n<mount app=\"auth\" mountpoint=\"middleware\" url=\"/\"/>\n[/code]\n\nThis will mount [link auth#views]Auth views[/link] and middleware which does the work of managing permissions.\n\n[aside]If you created your project with [b]moya start project[/b], then Moya Auth will have been installed automatically.[/aside]\n\n[h1]Init Command[/h1]\n\nThe Auth library has a command to create the default user and some other required object in the database. To run it, enter the following at the command line:\n\n[code]\n$ moya moya.auth#cmd.init\n[/code]\n\nThe command prompt will ask you for the credentials (username and password) and email address of the [i]super user[/i]. A super user is the first user created and will have the ability to perform any administration tasks.\n\n[alert]If you run this on a production server, be sure to use a strong password[/alert]\n\n[h1]Views[/h1]\n\nWhen mounted, the Auth library supplies a few views to allow visitors to login / logout and do other user account tasks, such as reseting their password.\n\nThis section lists the available views by their URL name. You can use the URL name to retrieve the actual URL with something like the following:\n\n[code xml]\n<get-url from=\"moya.auth\" name=\"login\" dst=\"url\" />\n[/code]\n\nOr in template...\n\n[code moyatemplate]\n<a href=\"{% url 'login' from 'moya.auth' %}\">Login</a>\n[/code]\n\n[alert]The URLs given here assume the Auth library was mounted on [b]/auth/[/b].[/alert]\n\n[h2]login[/h2]\n\n[c]/auth/login/[/c]\n\nDisplays a form with username and password form. If the login was successful, the user is forwarded to either [c]/[/c] or a path defined in the query value called [c]fwd[/c]. For example, [c]/auth/login/?fwd=/dashboard/[/c].\n\n[h2]logout[/h2]\n\n[c]/auth/logout[/c]\n\nLogs the user out and forwards them to [c]/[/c] or a path given in a query value called [c]fwd[/c].\n\n[h2]user_edit[/h2]\n\n[c]/auth/edit/[/c]\n\nA form to allow a user to edit basic details; their first / last name and timezone.\n\n[h2]forgot_password[/h2]\n\n[c]/auth/forgot-password/[/c]\n\nDisplays a form requesting the user's email address. If the email is recognized then Moya Auth will send the user a password reset email which contains a link. Clicking the link in the email will let them enter a new password.\n\nA link to this page is displayed in the login view.\n\n[h2]reset_password[/h2]\n\n[c]/auth/reset/{token}/[/c]\n\nThis is the view to handle password resets.\n\n[h1]User Model[/h1]\n\nWhen a user logs in, Moya looks up a user object from the database and stores it in the context as [c].user[/c]. If no user has logged in, the value of [c].user[/c] will be missing -- which allows you to write code such as this:\n\n[code xml]\n<if test=\".user\">\n    <echo>User is logged in </echo>\n</if>\n[/code]\n\nOr the equivalent in template:\n\n[code moyatemplate]\n{% if .user %}\n<h1>Welcome, ${.user.username}!</h1>\n{% endif %}\n[/code]\n\n[aside]The [b].user[/b] value in the context is actually calculated [i]lazily[/i], so that Moya won't query the database if you never reference [b].user[/b].[/aside]\n\n[definitions]\n\n[define username]\nThis is the user's [i]identity[/i] in the site. It will be a maximum of 30 characters with no spaces.\n[/define]\n\n[define first_name]\nThe user's first name (forename).\n[/define]\n\n[define last_name]\nThe user's last name (surname).\n[/define]\n\n[define email]\nThe user's email address.\n[/define]\n\n[define mail_validated]\nA boolean which indicates if the user's email has been [i]validated[/i].\n[/define]\n\n[define password]\nA [i]hash[/i] of the user's password. Moya follows the best practice of not storing the password has a hash rather than plain-text.\n[/define]\n\n[define timezone]\nThe user's [i]timezone[/i]. If set, Moya can use this information to display times and dates in the user's timezone.\n[/define]\n\n[define last_login]\nThe time of the user's most recent login. This will be the start of the current session if the user is logged in.\n[/define]\n\n[define previous_login]\nThe time the user logged in prior to the most recent login. Use this value in preference to [c]last_login[/c] when working out what has changed since the user's last logged in.\n[/define]\n\n[define notes]\nA text field for admin to store notes regarding a user.\n[/define]\n\n[define groups]\nA many to many of the [link auth#groups]groups[/link] a user belongs to. Including the user's personal group.\n[/define]\n\n[/definitions]\n\n[h1]Permissions and Groups[/h1]\n\nMoya Auth supports a flexible permissions system that you can user to manage different types of users and define what they can do or see.\n\n[aside]Many sites will only require two types of users; administrators and [i]everyone else[/i].[/aside]\n\n[h2]Permissions[/h2]\n\nA [i]permission[/i] is a label associated with a particular capability on the site. The default permissions (created with the [link auth#init_command]Init Command[/link]) are [c]'admin'[/c] which gives you access to the admin site, and [c]'superuser'[/c] which identifies you as the owner of the site.\n\nWhen a user is logged in, Moya stores the user's permissions in the context as a dict called [c].permissions[/c], which maps the permission label to a permission object (consisting of it's [c]name[/c] and [c]description[/c]). For example, if a user has the [c]admin[/c] permission, then [c].permission.admin[/c] would contain the following:\n\n[code]\n{\n    'name': 'admin',\n    'description': 'User may perform administration tasks'\n}\n[/code]\n\nYou can use the permissions object to test if a user has a particular permission as follows:\n\n[code xml]\n<if test=\".permissions.admin\">\n    <echo>The user is an Administrator!</echo>\n    <echo>${.permissions.admin.description}</echo>\n</if>\n[/code]\n\nAlternatively, there is a modifier, [c]permission:[/c] which checks the [c].permissions[/c] value. Here's the equivalent check to the above code, written with the modifier:\n\n[code xml]\n<if test=\"permission:'admin'\">\n    <echo>The user is an Administrator!</echo>\n</if>\n[/code]\n\nThe [c]permission:[/c] modifier also accept a list of permissions, and will return [c]True[/c] only if the user has [i]all[/i] of them.\n\n[code xml]\n<if test=\"permission:['admin', 'superuser']\">\n    <echo>User is an administrator and a superuser</echo>\n</if>\n[/code]\n\nThe modifier has the advantage that it is easier to define the permissions check in a setting. You might want to do this in a library if you don't want to hard-code the required permissions. Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<if test=\"not permission:.settings.post_permssions.list\">\n    <echo>Sorry, you are not permitted to post!</echo>\n</if>\n[/code]\n\n[h2]View Permissions[/h2]\n\nYou may want to restrict a URL to a users with a particular permission (for example, admin users). One way of doing this is to apply a permission check to the [tag]forbidden[/tag] tag which generates a [b]403 Forbidden[/b] response. The Moya Auth library handles this special response by forwarding the user to the login page.\n\nHere's how you might do a permission check in a view:\n\n[code xml]\n<forbidden if=\"not permission:'admin'\"/>\n[/code]\n\nBecause this is such a common pattern, the [tag]view[/tag] has a [c]requires[/c] attribute which will have the same effect. Here's how you would do the same permission check with the [c]requires[/c] attribute:\n\n[code xml]\n<view libname=\"view.admin\" requires=\"permission:'admin'\">\n    <!-- admin only view -->\n</view>\n[/code]\n\n[h2]URL Permissions[/h2]\n\nIt's often a requirement to have many views restricted to users with a particular permission, often under a single top level URL. It would be somewhat tedious to add a permissions check to all the views, and the consequences of a missing check could potentially be serious. In these situations you might want to add a [tag]url[/tag] to apply a permissions check.\n\nHere's how you would check for admin permissions for [i]any[/i] URL under [c]/admin-only/[/c]:\n\n[code xml]\n<url route=\"/admin-only/*\">\n    <forbidden if=\"not permission:'admin'\" />\n</url>\n[/code]\n\n[h2]Groups[/h2]\n\nPermissions are associated with [i]groups[/i] which may contain any number of users. Users in a group acquire all the permissions of that group. For example, there is a default group called [c]'administrators'[/c] which gives users the [c]'admin'[/c] permission, i.e. if you are in the [c]'administrators'[/c] group you will have the [c]'admin'[/c] permission.\n\nThe user object has a many to many of groups the user belongs to. Here's how you could list the groups for the logged in user:\n\n[code xml]\n<for src=\".user.groups\" dst=\"group\">\n    <echo>User belongs to ${group}</echo>\n</form>\n[/code]\n\nYou will rarely need to look at a users groups directly, as the [link auth#permissions]permissions[/link] will already have been determined.\n\n[h2]Personal Groups[/h2]\n\nPermissions are not strictly speaking associated with a user, but users can have a [i]personal group[/i] which is a special group unique to them. Adding a permission to this group will apply to that user and that user only. You can use this to tailor individual permissions for a user where there is no appropriate group to put them in.\n\n[h2]Default Groups and Permissions[/h2]\n\nThe [link auth#init-command]init command[/link] creates a small number of default groups and permission. These are the minimum requirements for most sites.\n\nThe init command creates a single group called [c]administrators[/c] which supplies a permission called [c]admin[/c]. Users with the [c]admin[/c] permission may log in to the admin site. The [c]admin[/c] permission also enables the editing of site content in some applications, e.g. editing pages, blog posts, FAQs etc.\n\nThe first user created is a member of the [c]administrator[/c] group, and also has a permission called [c]super[/c] assigned to their [i]personal[/i] group. You should use the [c]super[/c] permission to guard any potentially destructive operations that you wouldn't want to risk an administrator doing by accident.\n\n[h2]Managing Groups & Permissions[/h2]\n\nGenerally speaking, groups and permissions are relatively [i]static[/i] in that once created you will rarely need to change them -- probably only when you roll out features to your site. Creating groups and permissions can be done with either the [link auth#auth-commands]auth command[/link] or via the admin site.\n\nAdding a user to a group can be done with the [tag auth]add-user-to-group[/tag] tag, which takes a user object and the group to add to. For example, the following adds a user with username [c]'john'[/c] to the administrators group.\n\n[code xml]\n<db:get model=\"#User\" let:username=\"john\" dst=\"john\"/>\n<db:add-user-to-group let:user=\"john\" let:group=\"administrators\" />\n[/code]\n\nTo add a permission to a group (or a users's personal group) you can use [tag auth]add-permission[/tag] which takes either a user or group, and a permission name. For example, here is how you make a user a [i]superuser[/i] user by adding the [c]super[/c] permission to their personal group:\n\n[code xml]\n<db:get model=\"#User\" let:username=\"john\" dst=\"john\"/>\n<db:add-permission user=\"john\" permission=\"super\" />\n[/code]\n\n[aside]If everyone is [i]super[/i], nobody is.[/aside]\n\n\n[h1]Creating Users[/h1]\n\nYou can create a new user manually with [tag auth]new-user[/tag]. Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<auth:new-user username=\"john\"\n    email=\"john@moya.com\"\n    first_name=\"John\"\n    last_name=\"Crichton\"\n    password=\"aeryn1234\"\n    dst=\"john\"/>\n[/code]\n\nThis will create a new user with username [c]john[/c]. If that username is taken, Moya will raise a [c]moya.auth.duplicate-user[/c] exception.\n\nNote that the password will be hashed automatically.\n\n[h1]Logging In a User[/h1]\n\nYou can login a user for the current session with [tag auth]login[/tag] which takes a username and password. If the username exists and the password matches, then the user object will be returned (and stored in [c].user[/c]). Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<auth:login username=\"'john'\" password=\"'aeryn1234'\" dst=\"user\" />\n[/code]\n\nA few exception may be thrown by [tag auth]login[/tag] if the login was unsuccessful; the exception [c]\"moya.auth.no-user\"[/c] indicates the username was incorrect, [c]\"moya.auth.password-fail\"[/c] indicates the password was incorrect, and [c]\"moya.auth.not-active\"[/c] indicates the login was disabled.\n\n[h1]Logging Out a User[/h1]\n\nThe [tag auth]logout[/tag] will logout a given user, or the currently logged in user. For example, the following will log out the current user:\n\n[code xml]\n<auth:logout/>\n[/code]\n\n\n[h1]Setting / Checking Passwords[/h1]\n\nThe [tag auth]set-password[/tag] can set (and hash) a password for the given user. Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<auth:set-password user=\"john\" password=\"'ayom74'\" />\n[/code]\n\nYou can [i]check[/i] a password with the [tag auth]check-password[/tag] tag. Here's an example:\n\n[code xml]\n<auth:check-password user=\"john\" password=\"'ayom74'\" dst=\"passed\" />\n<if test=\"passed\">\n    <echo>Password is correct!</echo>\n</if>\n<else>\n    <echo>Password failed!</echo>\n</else>\n[/code]\n\n[h1]Auth Commands[/h1]\n\nMoya Auth has a number of commands you can invoke from the command line, including commands to create / edit permissions, groups and users.\n\nEnter the following from a project directory to view all the commands available:\n\n[code]\n$ moya auth#\n[/code]\n",
